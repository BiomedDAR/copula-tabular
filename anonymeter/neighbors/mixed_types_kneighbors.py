    r"""Distance between two records inspired by the Gower distance [1].

    To handle mixed type data, the distance is specialized for numerical (continuous)
    and categorical data. For numerical records, we use the L1 norm,
    computed after the columns have been normalized so that :math:`d(a_i, b_i)\leq 1`
    for every :math:`a_i`, :math:`b_i`. For categorical, :math:`d(a_i, b_i)` is 1,
    if the entries :math:`a_i`, :math:`b_i` differ, else, it is 0.

    Notes
    -----
    To keep the balance between numerical and categorical values, the input records
    have to be properly normalized. Their numerical part need to be scaled so that
    the difference between any two values of a column (from both dataset) is *at most* 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r0 : np.array

    r1 : np.array
        Input array of shape (D,).
    cat_cols_index : int

        ``r0[:cat_cols_index]`` are the numerical columns, and ``r0[cat_cols_index:]`` are
        the categorical ones. For a fully numerical dataset, use ``cat_cols_index =
        len(r0)``. For a fully categorical one, set ``cat_cols_index`` to 0.

    float
        distance between the records.
