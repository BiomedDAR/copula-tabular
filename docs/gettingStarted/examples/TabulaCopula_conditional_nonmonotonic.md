### Example of TabulaCopula Class
This example demonstrates the use of the TabulaCopula class to generate synthetic data for a multivariate simulated dataset (socialdata), between variables of known non-linear, non-monotonic relationships.

The dataset contains 7 simulated variables with the following relationships:
